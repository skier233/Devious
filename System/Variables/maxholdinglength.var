Maximum Edge Holding Length
The maximum time in seconds that an edge holding cycle will last. NOTE: Edge holding cycle length will vary between min and max length based on domme's mood and apathy level. The domme will choose closer to the minimum most of the time unless they are pissed so make the maximum your absolute max limit.
